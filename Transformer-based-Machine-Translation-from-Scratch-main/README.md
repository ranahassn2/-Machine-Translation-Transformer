# Transformer-based Machine Translation from Scratch

## Overview
This repository contains a project that implements machine translation using Transformer models from scratch. The goal is to understand and apply the principles behind the Transformer architecture to develop a robust machine translation system.

## Project Structure
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains the Jupyter notebook with the implementation and analysis.
- **`data/`**: Directory for storing the dataset (not included in the repository for size reasons).
- **`models/`**: Directory to save trained models and checkpoints.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the project, including model definitions and training scripts.

## Features
- Detailed explanation and implementation of the Transformer model.
- Step-by-step guide on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Examples and results demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-machine-translation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd transformer-machine-translation
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the notebook and train the model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the `data/` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Navigate to the notebook `Transformer-based Machine Translation from Scratch.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

## Results
The project demonstrates the development and evaluation of a Transformer-based machine translation system. Key results include:

- High accuracy and fluency in translated text.
- Effective handling of different languages and text complexities.
